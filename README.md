Title: HOLISTIC-PD: A Holistic Multimodal Framework for Quantifying Parkinson’s Disease Severity
Goal: Develop an accurate prediction model for Parkinson's Disease (PD) tremor severity and overall PD severity using IMU sensor data and clinical data.
Approach: You used feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant IMU features for predicting PD tremor severity and evaluated multiple machine learning models for performance.

## Holistic Multimodal Features: IMU + MDS-UPDRS + PDQ-39

## Interpretability & Insights
   
The combination of sensor data and clinical scores increases the model’s ability to capture complex patterns associated with PD tremor severity.
You might have also analyzed ROC Curves, Confusion Matrices, and Feature Importances to validate and interpret the models.

## Key Insights
Selected IMU features provide reliable tremor severity prediction.
Multimodal data fusion (IMU + clinical scores) enhances PD severity prediction accuracy.
Best model: Voting Classifier (IMU).
